# Command-Line Usage Guide

## Usage:
```sh
$ icp-test <command>
$ icp-test <command> --help

This format makes the command list more readable and structured properly for a `README.md`. Let me know if you need further refinements! ðŸš€

Available Commands:
Command	Description
help	Show help information about the commands.
cwd	Display the path of the current location.
deploy	Deploy canisters on the mainnet.
new <projectName>	Create a new ICP project.

### **How to Save It as `README.md`?**  
1. Create a file named `README.md` in your project directory.  
2. Copy and paste the above content into the file.  
3. Save the file.  

Now your `README.md` will display a properly formatted **Available Commands** table when viewed on GitHub or any markdown-supported platform. ðŸš€
